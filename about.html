                    Borak Polytechnic Institute (BPI) is a social business venture of Unique Group. Mohd Noor Ali,
                    Managing Director of Unique Group is the architect of BPI and always very passionate to this
                    technical learning center. We got affiliation from government in 2016 to be operated at Goshbagh,
                    Ashulia, Dhaka. BPI never tries to be a traditional polytechnic but an industry-driven digital
                    higher learning institution in Bangladesh. Promoting technical education for achieving the targets
                    set by Bangladesh Government in 2021, 2030 and 2041 is the ultimate aim of Borak Polytechnic
                    Institute. We are working with MoE, DTE and BTEB as partner to uphold the vision and mission of TVET
                    program of the country. Our focus is on Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Computer engineering while
                    Textile and Garments Design and Pattern Making are the local market demand. It is our pleasure that
                    BPI started its operation from the very first day at its permanent campus with 7 acre of land. Till
                    now, we are providing free hostel facility to our remote students.</h3>
